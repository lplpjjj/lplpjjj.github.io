Welcome to my website! I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor of Digital Communication in the [Department of Advertising & Public Relations](https://cis.ua.edu/departments/apr/) at [The University of Alabama's College of Communication & Information Sciences](https://cis.ua.edu). My research centers on the convergence of **advocacy communication, social media, social networks, and computational social science**. I draw heavily on network theory and machine learning to explain communication behaviors and outcomes in digital advocacy.

I employ a diverse range of quantitative and computational methods, including **surveys, inferential network modeling, machine learning, natural language processing (NLPs), structural equation modeling, and path analysis**. Qualitative methods such as in-depth interviews and participatory observation complement my research. My work has been published in leading peer-reviewed journals across communication, information science, and interdisciplinary fields. You will most likely see me in conferences like [ICA](https://www.icahdq.org), [NCA](https://www.natcom.org), [AEJMC](https://www.aejmc.org), and [ICS2S](https://ic2s2-2024.org).

Before joining UA, I earned my Ph.D. at the [Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, USC](https://annenberg.usc.edu). I hold an M.Phil. in Communication, a B.S.Sc. in Journalism and Communication, and a B.B.A. in Finance from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk).

My current projects examine the strategic communication and network building of nonprofits in the U.S.; political behaviors and social media; and the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in communication and social science and their consequences. If you are interested in these topics, please reach out for a collaboration, a conversation, or simply, a recommendations of my favorite paper.
