Welcome to my website! I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, USC](https://annenberg.usc.edu). My research centers on the convergence of **advocacy communication, social justice, and social networks**. I draw heavily on network theory and ecological perspectives to explain communication behaviors and outcomes in digital advocacy. I am co-supervised by [Prof. Larry Gross](https://annenberg.usc.edu/faculty/larry-p-gross) and [Prof. Lindsay Young](https://annenberg.usc.edu/faculty/lindsay-young).

I employ a diverse range of **quantitative and computational analytical tools**, including inferential network modeling, machine learning, natural language processing (NLPs), structural equation modeling, and path analysis. Qualitative methods such as in-depth interviews and participatory observation complement my research.

Specifically, my ongoing and future research agenda revolves around three major themes: (1) strategic and advocacy communication with a focus on ethnic, sexual, and gender minority groups in complex information and media environments; (2) information dynamics and social networks that influence policy, health, and risk communication outcomes; (3) political attitudes and behaviors in digital intergroup contexts.

**I am looking for academic positions in fields such as communication, information science, and computational social science in the recruitment cycle 2023-2024.**
